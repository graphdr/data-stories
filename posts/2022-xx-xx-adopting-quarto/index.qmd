## Background

I have blogged intermittently since 2014. My original blog was in WordPress with the beautiful and sparse [tru](https://tru.spyr.me/) theme. Writing prose and including images was not difficult, but including R code was clunky at best. And I was unable to resolve the issues that prevented my blog from being included in [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).

When I discovered the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package, I drafted some blog posts in rmarkdown and published on GitHub pages. There were some bumpy spots and workarounds, but creating R-focused posts was straightforward and comfortable given my experience with reproducible authoring using rmarkdown, knitr, etc.

As an aside, I experimented with [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/) at the same time I tried distill. I'm certain that blogdown works beautifully for many folks, but for me, distill took me farther faster with fewer hangups.

I enjoyed writing with distill. The only significant issue was, again, an inability to create a full RSS feed suitable for submitting to R-bloggers ([#376](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/376)).

Looking for suggestions on fixing the RSS feed, I came across a similar discussion on a quarto page. One of the contributors (thanks [Bryan](https://github.com/bryanhanson)!) had a distill workaround but suggested I take a look at quarto. I did. He was right. Eventually---with some expeditious bug fixing ([#946](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/946))---I could use [quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create a blog (this site) that met the requirements for aggregation on R-bloggers.

## Get started with quarto

The getting started with quarto guidelines have been done. I'll just point you to the readings I found helpful.

-   [Porting a distill blog to quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) by Danielle Navarro

-   [Get started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on the quarto website

The quarto features I like, compared to distill, are

-   `_metadata.yml` for applying settings to all posts, shortening the YAML header of individual posts
-   `_quarto.yml` with the usual website organization structure plus additional formatting applied to all posts
-   Full RSS feed with categories and an XML file that passes muster with an RSS feed checker.
