My original blog was in WordPress with the beautiful and sparse [tru](https://tru.spyr.me/) theme. Writing prose and including images was not difficult, but including R code was clunky at best. And I was unable to resolve the issues that prevented my blog from being included in [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).\n\nWhen I discovered the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package, I drafted some blog posts in rmarkdown and published on GitHub pages. There were some bumpy spots and workarounds, but creating R-focused posts was straightforward and comfortable given my experience with reproducible authoring using rmarkdown, knitr, etc.\n\nAs an aside, I experimented with [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/) at the same time I tried distill. I'm certain that blogdown works beautifully for many folks, but for me, distill took me farther faster with fewer hangups.\n\nI enjoyed writing with distill. The only significant issue was, again, an inability to create a full RSS feed suitable for submitting to R-bloggers ([#376](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/376)).\n\nLooking for suggestions on fixing the RSS feed, I came across a similar discussion on a quarto page. One of the contributors (thanks [Bryan](https://github.com/bryanhanson)!) had a distill workaround but suggested I take a look at quarto. I did. He was right. Eventually---with some expeditious bug fixing ([#946](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/946))---I could use [quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create a blog (this site) that met the requirements for aggregation on R-bloggers.\n\n## Get started with quarto\n\nThe getting started with quarto guidelines have been done. I'll just point you to the readings I found helpful.\n\n-   [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) by Alison Hill\n-   [Porting a distill blog to quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) by Danielle Navarro\n-   [Notes on changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/) by Nick Tierney\n-   [Get started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on the quarto website\n\nThe quarto features I like, compared to distill, are\n\n-   `_metadata.yml` for applying settings to all posts, shortening the YAML header of individual posts\n-   `_quarto.yml` with the usual website organization structure plus additional formatting applied to all posts\n-   Full RSS feed with categories and an XML file that passes muster with an RSS feed checker.\n\n## The niggles\n",
